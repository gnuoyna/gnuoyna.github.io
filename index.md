I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering  from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of  [Prof. Zili Shao](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~shao/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I am interested in spatio-temporal data management, storage system, and cloud database.
